THE PROFESSOR VS 

THE INHABITANTS OF 

FLUTE ISLAND 



Waking in a foreign country is never 

as disorienting as one would 

presume it to be, in large part due 

to that familiar texture that is common to 

reality, wherever it may be happening. I felt 

like Huck Finn setting out, going out on the 

sly like this, on my new door, thinking less 

about arriving somewhere and more about getting away from somewhere. I 

set my suitcase on the door and pushed off. I had dug up a long branch near 

the shore and, while it wasn't very straight, it was mighty long. 

Good old Huck Finn. I must idolize him. He's stuck somewhere deep. I 
could never get my engines going to be a rich guy. I stayed right at freelance 
professor. 

You see, it was common practice among all of the nerds of the 80s to 
see in themselves either a Bill Gates or a Steve Jobs. And even all the adults 
would go on about this, too, "Hey, are you going to be the next Bill Gates?" 
They saw it as the two extremes: Gates, intrepid, brilliant, conniving— a 
programmer and a businessman; and, well, on the other side, was Jobs: 
handsome, classy, passionate, counterculture even— being friends with that 
old hacker-whistler Cap'n Crunch. 



These two weren't but two sides of the same coin. The Rich Computer 
Guys Of The Late Twentieth-Century Commemorative Coin. They 



represented that old rags-to-riches ideal that's so intoxicating to our society. 
At the same time, there was a torment I could see that those thrones held. 

With Gates, it was that no one really liked his software. Sorry, but at 
least among his peers— the other bright minds and innovators— Windows 
was a kind of curse that he'd blighted us with. People who liked Windows 
didn't really like Windows— they were just demonstrating how pragmatic 
and down-to-earth they were. 

And in Jobs' case, here's a guy who just couldn't get along with anyone. 
When you look at it, who really wanted to be either of these guys? The ego on 
these two capitalists was breathtaking! Old Steve Jobs had himself a doozie 
of a God complex, coming down from the mount to give us our new set of 
tablets before riding back into the sky on a brushed steel chariot of fire. 

Nah, I liked Huck Finn. He flew by the seat of his pants. Even after he 
and Tom Sawyer struck it rich, his drunk dad was still stealing through the 
window to breathe on him. Even with the niceties of the Widow Douglas, 
Huck gets an itch and he gets outta therel 

It took many hours to reach the next island to the west. Doors just don't 
move very fast. And my stick sucked. It was late evening when I arrived. I 
hammered my frustrations on the door, but nobody answered. I hauled it 
ashore and made a lean-to just inside the forest. 

It was actually very nice under the door. It made a nice roof, but not a 
nice floor. 

I set out again the next morning, collecting blackberries. I ate as many 
as I could. I hardly put a dent in the whole crop. And then my eye caught 
something through the space in leaves. A stagnant lake sat behind this 
corridor of berries, and a hill went up from it, and a number of men were 
gathering around a hole halfway up the hill. There were about seven of them, 
Frenchmen by the look of it. I only say that because they wore black 
turtlenecks and blue jeans and because they looked quite emaciated and 



appeared to be old. They had a way of hunching over, but maybe that was 
because of the hole, it was awkwardly placed halfway up the hill on an incline. 
Then they all came out of the hole and closed it off with a wooden lid. 

They wound their way around the hill and I followed them, moving 
along the lines of blackberry bushes, which made a concentric circle around 
the hill. Once I caught up with them, maybe thirty yards off to their side, they 
started to sense me and a few looked at me, I thought I was well concealed, 
but they could clearly see me through the bushes, and made no motions to 
me, so I continued walking and looking at them, making no sign to them 
either. For some reason, it felt that they should say hi to me, you'd think the 
burden of introduction would be on the larger group rather than one person, 
but I had forgotten that I could play the role of the lost individual, simply 
looking for directions, instead I followed along as they walked down the hill. 
In a short time, they were all looking at me, walking at my same pace, and 
they were hunched over, something simian about this. They had an 
inscrutable look in their eyes, like animals. Then they wound around the hill 
again and their path went down a dark ravine and they disappeared from 
view. 

I hurried to follow them. I went down the dark ravine and went into a 
cave at the end. The men were gathered inside, standing in a circle with their 
heads together. There was little light and no sense of human presence. It was 
cold and they stood like stones. One man who had a ripped sleeve turned to 
me and said harshly, "Shut the door." He held a metal tube in his hand. 

I stepped back. "You want me to shut the door?" 

It turned out that I had misheard him because the man with the ripped 
sleeve repeated himself and it was in French, "C'est de dore." 

I didn't know, still don't, what "de dore" would mean. 

I departed the cave and walked on the pathway. I left the ravine and 
stood aside. I thought of going back in, maybe that was rude to run away. But 



I had the feeling they didn't want me in there. Maybe that was just me being 
insecure, I feel like people don't naturally like me. If I was wrong, maybe one 
of them would come out and get me. Maybe they did like me, because they 
had looked at me for a long time while we were walking. 

I thought of those old French street signs that I had seen out on the 
coast. Was there an old guard of misplaced Frenchmen living out here, 
surviving in this wild? And then a detail of their clothing came to me as I 
stood there. New Balance. They had all been wearing identical shoes. I hadn't 
seen it in the cave, but as they walked, it was the tips of their shoes that gave 
it away, the tips of their shoes went up, like New Balance. And then I thought, 
so these weren't Frenchies at all, but some kind of a group or a clan that 
followed Steve Jobs, all dressed the same. 

I went back into the cave and I stopped short, for it was empty. I walked 
slowly inside, but there was nothing there. My eyes adjusted, though, and fell 
upon a wooden lid in the middle of the cave wall on the side. I lifted it and 
climbed inside the tunnel behind it. I kept my foot in the lid for a moment to 
make a light inside, but the tunnel turned off so that I couldn't see where it 
went. I let the lid close and climbed on. 

In a while, I reached another lid, so I pushed it open. I had come out 
on the side of the hill where I had first seen them sniffing around. There was 
no one here and it was still gray and murky all around me. 

I walked back to my door and laid underneath it. I wondered if I should 
have run around the hill one more time, to see if they had gone back to the 
cave. But then I thought that, if they wanted to avoid me, they would have 
just crawled back into the hole again, and we could have been doing that over 
and over for some time. So it was better to just read my book and rest up. I 
could try to find them again tomorrow. I got out Frances Johnson and read 
about five pages before I fell asleep. 

I had a dream that I was taking pictures of a piece of rope. And the rope 
was positioning itself in a lot of slinky positions. As I took photographs, I felt 



somewhat surprised that a fuss hasn't been made about Frances Johnson at 
all. You never hear anyone talking about. Sure I've mentioned it a few times 
so far, because it was in my suitcase, but that's not quite enough, I'd say, 
because it's probably the greatest book to come out of this century so far. 
People will not agree with that, of course, because Frances doesn't tackle any 
big issues that we like to think about. But there are a lot of adults acting like 
children in Stacey Levine books. Maybe we'll look back and see that adults 
acting like children was a major issue that we were dealing with at the turn 
of the century. Maybe over-seriousness is a really big issue we're dealing 
with. Come to think of it, I don't know what we're dealing with actually, 
especially since everyone is dealing with such different things than what I'm 
dealing with. For instance, many people struggle with acceptance, feeling like 
they aren't accepted by other people. But what I deal with is primarily hatred 
of entrepreneurs. But it's something that I'm always working on and I've 
gotten much better. 

I woke up from under the door and went back out to take a stroll 
through the woods. I lived here know and felt it was time to find my place. I 
started by heading down to the blackberry bushes to gas up. I felt I would 
never tire of them, in fact, I like to eat blackberries because one time I was at 
Red Apple Market and they had a giant blackboard out front with the top ten 
best fruits that you can eat and the first one was blackberries. I guess they're 
the best. I ate a few more and, again, spotted the Frenchmen through that 
space in the branches, all gathered around their hole. Holy cow, I had 
forgotten about them already! 

I ran out, but wanted to come up on them quietly, so I padded softly, 
but determinedly, up the hill until I stood by them. 

"So what's this old hole about?" I said with my arms crossed. 

They looked up at me in surprise, holding their hands up. Again I saw 
the one with the ripped sleeve, holding his metal tube, cowering next to the 
hole. He gave me a perturbed look. They shook their heads when they saw 
that it was me and turned back to the hole. One of the men was flipping up 



the lid of the hole and commenting on it, as if to say something was broken 
about it, though the hinge seemed sturdy and the wood thick. 

Trying to instigate them a little further, I cleared my throat and said, 
"So why do all of you look like Steve Jobs?" 

They paid no notice to me and I tried saying again, "Steve Jobs, right? 
Steve Jobs?" Trying to say it in a French way even, to try and coax some 
recognition out of them, but they made no connection and went right on 
motioning at the door and flipping its lid up. 

I tried a bit of my own French at this point, wondering if that might 
catch them. "Qu'est ce que vous fairez... vous fais?" I said, not too sure. But I 
was basically trying to say, "What are you guys doing?" 

They looked around and one of them hummed a little and said, "C'est 
que faites-vous?" Which I didn't understand and which didn't even seem like 
correct French to me. 

I tried again. "Qu'est ce que... err, how would you say, 'What's going 
on?' Uhh... ca va?" I said, which I knew meant, "How's it going." 

The man speaking to me stood up. He repeated "ga va" as if he didn't 
understand and said something else in French that seemed to mean, "What 
are you going?" I asked him if he spake English and he said something like, 
"Do you speak French?" but he used the term "Franchais" for "French". 

I tried some numbers with him and said, "Un. Deux. Trois." He said, 
"Oui. Un. Deux. Trois." I did the next few numbers and he understood those. 
Then I said, "Seven." And he didn't know that one. I said "sept" again, maybe 
I had pronounced it wrong. He said, "Non." I said, "There are seven men 
here." He said, "No, there are eleven (onze) men here." I looked around, to 
be sure, but there were only seven. I said, "Seven." And then he flashed his 
fingers at me to count them out and I saw that he only had three fingers on 
each hand. 



What kind of derelicts were these Steve Jobs? I said again, "Steve Jobs? 
Savez-vous Steve Jobs?" All he said was, "Que'st ce que? Hein?" I didn't have 
anything else to say, so we looked around at everyone else for a little while 
and then I shrugged and motioned to him and he did likewise and we sat 
down. 

I looked around at all of these old guys with great interest. They said 
nothing, but seemed to be surveying the hill intently around. Whereas they 
had seemed like primates as they loped about earlier, they began to look 
positively avian as they squatted on the hill and peered about them. They 
were universally thin and grey, with hair in disarray, some were shorter, most 
had fascinating crooked noses, maybe this is what had made me think of 
birds, and, again, they all wore the black turtleneck and the jeans. They were 
certainly disheveled, but the attire had such an air of practicality and 
nonchalance that I couldn't help but wonder if maybe Jobs had struck gold 
with this, had discovered the universal fashion. 

I felt no discomfort or desire to leave, but felt immense curiosity about 
this group and was possessed by a desire to blend in. For me, old men are 
very appealing, much in the same way that children are very appealing to 
many people. Actually, I see very little difference between old men and little 
children. Well, no, that's not quite right, I feel a difference, but I feel the same 
air from these two groups. Neither group is entangled at all, in the ridiculous 
seriousness, in the business and economics, in the urgency of time. However, 
if a child or an elderly person IS caught up in these things, it is fantastic to 
see, it is hugely comical, especially when done earnestly, how it mocks the 
adult world, how satirical it is! (This reminds me of a time when I came upon 
a set of brothers who had a drink stand, and it turned out they were selling 
Arnold Palmers, in polo shirts no less, but they and the other children were 
calling them "Amora Palmers" which sounded fiendishly delicious: 
lemonade and iced tea and an aphrodisiac.) And so I find old men to be a 
great delight and I think fondly of the times when I would chat on the lawn 
with my neighbor many years ago, a German man, and he would tell me 
stories of being drafted in the German army, of fighting the Poles up and 



down the buildings, of losing his town to the same Poles, of hating the Poles 
and leaving everything behind, of the bombing of Dresden. When I think of 
it, I feel such a pang of regret that I never recorded it all down and that he is 
assuredly lost now and that we never skimmed the surface of what he could 
have told me. I think of riding in my grandfather's MG. I think of the times 
that I have squeezed an old person's hand and they haven't let go. One time 
a woman squeezed my hand and wouldn't let go and she was young but I 
despised it. But when an old woman squeezes my hand, I wait to see if she 
will let go and I hope she doesn't let go. Now I sat on the hill among these old 
men, I had no concept of time, perhaps it was 11, or perhaps it was 3 in the 
afternoon. I looked back at the one who had been speaking with me, I had 
already begun to mentally call him "Herbert" for some reason, he seemed to 
be very aware of me and was uncomfortably darting his eyes back to me, and 
even looked at me imploringly, as one who is helpless and impatient. 
"Herbert" held his hands like a praying mantis, not tightly though, but at the 
sides of his chest, while the others held their arms limply at their sides. Their 
skin was filthy. 

I ventured away, to eat blackberries again, still keeping an eye on the 
flock. I don't know how I had gotten into this habit of eating so frequently. I 
was dependent on this nervous habit all of the sudden, or maybe the 
blackberries just weren't hitting the spot. I couldn't get enough. I realized 
this and I stopped immediately, then meandered slowly up the hill again. I 
sat in the midst of the Jobsian derelicts. I watched the man with the ripped 
sleeve, he put the metal tube to his mouth and made noises with it from time 
to time, it was a piccolo. It seemed to have three holes along the top and one 
near the thumb, which he covered with the flap of skin between thumb and 
forefinger. He played short, quick songs, all of which seemed very off-key and 
absurd, like free jazz sped up. Some of the other men took out piccolos of 
their own, though they didn't make any effort to play them, but were content 
to flutter their fingers over the holes and only chime in after each song, 
saying, "Dune." After a few minutes of this, the man with the ripped sleeve 
seemed to enter an extended piccolo tirade, playing for what must have been 
twenty minutes, thirty minutes, perhaps more, breaking occasionally to 
breathe, but then getting right back to it, hammering out the trills, piping 



until I got the giggles, was this how Alzheimer's patients would live in the 
wild?? I tried to find a way to enjoy this music, but it was so random and 
hermetic, high, flinty, and impossible to predict, it felt anthropologically 
valuable, sure, but that's it, I couldn't kick the feeling that it was too primitive 
a kind of world music, too low in its evolution, devoid of important nuance 
and dynamic. In short, my American disdain was hearing its name called, 
and I got annoyed with the laborsome tune. I was past this kind of thing. And 
when it really got to me, I closed my eyes to shut it out but only found it closer 
there, I was unable to escape the piercing inanity of the piccolo's perpetual 
climb and fall until it was done. Again, it was probably thirty or forty minutes 
in total, and the other men said, "Dune," which I can translate to you now as, 
"Acknowledged." Then the men waited again and, in just moments, the 
wooden lid over the hole began to clatter something fierce, as if a terrible 
wind was speaking through it. The man with the ripped sleeve turned to the 
hole and opened the lid and wind came through the tunnel and hit the man, 
shooting his hair back and tossing itself through his clothes with abandon. 
Now here's what happened: something spilled out of the hole, at first I 
thought it was a large rotisserie chicken, but the wind died down and they 
picked the thing up, a man slung the thing over his shoulder, it was a young 
boy, naked, holding his eyes shut, with his legs kicking a little, a boy streaked 
with dirt stains and rocks in his skin that I had taken to be a rub. They carried 
him down the hill and one of these Jobsian derelicts, a man with a pith 
helmet on, came running ahead with a folded set of clothes under his arm, a 
small black turtleneck and jeans for the boy. They put the kid down and 
dressed him, guiding his legs, for he was suffering from exhaustion. The boy 
had his arms by his side and I could see he had three fingers. They also put 
New Balance on him and then he was put over the shoulder again and 
carried. They were leaving, I ran back to my camp, the space under the 
propped-up door, and grabbed my suitcase. 

When I caught up with them, they were standing in the trailway. The 
boy was still being held and the men had pooled together. On the side of the 
trail, the man with the ripped sleeve had collapsed and "Herbert" was 
stooped down over him with another man. They were holding the hand of the 
man with the ripped shirt and listening to his chest. I knelt down by the 



collapsed man and looked over him. He was motionless. I said, "II est 
fatigue?" 

"Herbert" said to me, "C'est mort." ("It is dead.") I put my hand over 
my mouth. "Herbert" shrugged. 

I checked the man's neck, but felt nothing. Maybe I was doing it wrong. 
I checked a few times. "Comment?" I said. 

The other man who knelt with us began taking the collapsed man's 
pants off. "Herbert" took the piccolo out of the man's pocket and got up. He 
offered the piccolo to another man in the group. This man took the piccolo 
and shrugged, patting his head and laughing. The group seemed relieved, 
many were swinging their arms and laughing. 

This disturbed me very much and I walked away from the group. 
Where did this boy come from? He seemed impaired. What if he was 
crippled? I felt very troubled and watched the group from afar. "Herbert" 
walked over to me, humming pleasantly and snapping his fingers. He said, 
in French, "It is fine. It returns." 

I said, "Non, non. C'est mort. Tu sais." 

He said, "No, it is not there. It returns tomorrow morning." 

"Tomorrow morning?" I said. 

"Oui,"hesaid."Onyva." 

He walked on, fanning the entire group ahead with his hands. They 
moved on through the woods, the sun beginning to peek out for the first time 
in my travels. 

I continued to follow them and thought, "I'm not responsible for this 
group. In fact, they're much older than me, so they know what they're doing. 



Who am I to tell a bunch of old men what to do?" But then I thought of Uncle 
Chuck on the island and my conversation with the dentist. 

"Well, this isn't bestiality," I said to myself. "This is just a kid who can't 
walk and a man who died. These aren't crimes. I should learn to be more 
accepting. I've just been on my computer for too long." 

The forest was very large. We walked for many hours. We must have 
been on part of Eleanor Island. And Eleanor must extend into a much larger 
peninsula, because there's no way that it just ends in half of a mile. The day 
was very beautiful and we followed a cluster of trees that had been razed in 
many parts, so that a trail kept the sky in view and, in some places, a slender 
stream interacted with the trail, and we walked over it many times. We 
stopped a few times during our journey, once at an hour and a half, another 
time at nearly four hours. The men would relieve themselves at these stops 
and the boy, too, was taught to relieve himself. This was simpler than 
expected. The man with the pith helmet simply pointed at the edges of the 
woods, where several other men were urinating. The kid walked over and 
stood by the edge of the forest. He stood there for maybe fifteen minutes and 
then we could hear the sound of water on leaves. The man with the pith 
helmet smiled at me. I couldn't help smiling as well and I gave the man with 
the pith helmet a thumbs up. He gave the same sign back to me. 

The second time we stopped, they began to play some piccolo music for 
the boy. One of the men, a very average-looking man from the group, sat on 
the ground and played a short song for the boy. Then he said, in French, "It 
is understood." The other men said, "Dune." He played it again and said, "It 
is understood." The other men said, again, "Dune." The average-looking man 
motioned to the boy. He waited and then he motioned again and then he said, 
"Dune." I could tell they wanted the boy to say it, too, so I sat next to the boy 
and said, "Dune," then pointed to him. I said it again and pointed to him. The 
boy said, "Dune." 

The average-looking man played the song again. And then we all said, 
"Dune." The next song was all numbers. They went through each note and 



each note matched with one of the six numbers. Then he would play through 
the song and the numbers would add up. (I don't remember all of the notes, 
but number songs always started with C#-F.) We got through the numbers 
and said, "Dune." Then they taught a story with a song and it went like this: 
The sky was a note and the forest was a note and the ground was a note and 
a man was a note. Then he glued these things together using the same 
addition he used with numbers. So he had a skyman and a forestman and a 
groundman. 

His song went on, saying that the skyman was equal to one and the 
forestman was equal to two and the groundman was equal to three. I 
envisioned costumes for each of these characters. I couldn't decide with the 
groundman if he was made of ground or if he had a canvas sack on. I pictured 
him coming up from under the ground and taking a drink from the stream. 
Then the song said that the difference between the skyman and the 
groundman was eighty-six. This puzzled me and I looked at the boy. His eyes 
were open and he said, "Dune," when the song ended. 

I thought, "This must be an allegory for how the math works here." And 
I left it to my subconscious to sort it out. 

The hike took us to a valley where another group was camping. It was 
a kind of bowl that had been dug up, perhaps by lumberjacks. The night was 
growing stormy and the men hid away under boards that were lodged in the 
dirt over small, shallow foxholes. The man with the pith helmet took me and 
the boy down to a set of boards toward the bottom of the pit. We sat on piles 
of telephone books. (I say these were telephone books, but they were more 
like magazines, they dated back to the 1980s and were labelled, "Port 
Frampton, Washington," they had no telephone numbers, just lists of names 
and corresponding ham radio call signs, I looked through quite a number of 
these, the names and call signs never seemed to change, from year to year.) 

I was distracted from looking at the phone books once I realized that 
the boy was playing a piccolo. The man in the pith helmet had given it to him 
and was saying, "Dune," and smiling after each little song. I sat there and ate 



my cold cuts. The boy went through the numbers and we said, "Dune." He 
went through the sky and the forest and the ground again and we said, 
"Dune," and he brought us all the way to 86. Then the man in the pith helmet 
took back the flute and taught us a few more things, including how to convey 
shapes and sizes, whether a person is old or young, sick or dead, and how to 
warn someone about an evil presence. 

As we did this, "Herbert" came around and stood aside while we 
listened. At first I had thought he had come to see the man with the pith 
helmet, but when the lesson had ended, "Herbert" tapped my arm and said, 
"It is seeing," and he took me outside. 

The night was clear and I pointed up. "La lune!" And I looked at him 
and he smiled. "La nuit! Avec les etoiles!" But as I looked closer, I could see 
in the moonlight all the pores on his skin and his face looked very gaunt. I 
stood back in horror and peered at him, he was somehow smaller. 

"Herbert," I said (with a silent tee and in a voice of awe), "C'est 
vieillesse?" (Which is to say, "Are you old?" in what I approximated his 
language to be.) 

He said, "64? 65?" 

"I don't know," I said. "Yes?" 

"Oui," he said. "64. 65." 

He took me down to a cave with lights within. I came to know this room 
as the "flute box". It was a place where the men came to mold the new 
piccolos and it was often crammed with men of all ages. Even the boy came 
down to work here the next morning. The men had collected some old flutes 
and melted them down, they would go into newer molds, adding holes and 
attachments in the process. That night, the recent innovation was a slender 
point on the open end of the piccolo. In time I learned that this was used to 
spear fish and carve trees and replaced the jagged metal (usually cut from 



can lids) that some of the men carried around. They were happily ditching 
their old can lids into the fire and finishing a new flute. 

I sat against the side of the cave, talking to "Herbert" as well as I could, 
marveling to him about the utility of these flutes. I asked him who had 
invented the flute. He said that it was a man called "Trepite" who came 
through there very often. 

"Is he one of you?" I asked. 

He said, "Yes, he is a man from here." 

"The flute is very clever," I said. "I am starting to understand." 

He said, "That is how we know to make flutes." 

"How?" I said. 

He said, "We play the flute to teach how to make a flute." 

I took this to mean that the flute could be used to teach someone else 
how to make a flute. I found this quite amazing, that the device could 
perpetuate itself in this way. 

"Does it teach anything else?" I said. 

"Oh, how to walk the area," he said. "And how to raise children." 

"Really?" I said. It occurred to me that they could use the flutes to 
describe a whole landscape, to transfer a map from one man's mind to 
another. 

I wondered that I had not seen them eating at all. I asked him what 
they did for food. 



"We do not eat," he said. 

"No," I said. "You must!" 

"No," he laughed. "It is not necessary." 

In the light, it was clear that he was running very ragged. He looked 
very depleted, in comparison to earlier, so much that I could hardly believe 
it was the same man. I tried to get him to come back with me to eat some of 
the food in my suitcase, but he only laughed. His hands sat at his side like a 
praying mantis, though he turned them over as he talked. 

The next morning I woke up and the man with the pith helmet and the 
boy were gone. I got right out of bed and went outside, where it was overcast, 
and some of the men were loitering about, pondering their flutes. I walked 
from hovel to hovel, seeing only empty holes. I went further up the pit and 
eventually discovered a young guy in his twenties who was wearing the pith 
helmet. 

I asked him, "Where is the old man?" I pointed to his hat. 

He looked all around and then at me again. He was smiling. 

I said, "The old man." I pointed at his hat again. "That's the old man's 
hat." 

The guy said, "Dune," and smiled. 

I felt a bit perturbed that he couldn't see that I was a little impatient, 
but I stopped myself and tried to settle down. Clearly this guy couldn't 
understand me. 

I whistled a series, "l. 2. 3." 

He said, "Dune." 



I whistled, "The old man." 

He nodded. "Dune." And then he whistled, "He is dead." 

I said, "Dune?" I whistled, "The little boy." 

He said, "Dune." He whistled, "I am the little boy." He was certainly 
wearing a black turtleneck and jeans and the New Balance, too. 

I said, "Dune." 

Then I ran down the hill, asking each of the men along the way, 
"Where's Herbert? Where's Herbert?" No one could tell me. I went back to 
the cave and took out a sheet of paper and a pen out of a plastic bag. I wrote 
the date on the top of the paper. I figured it was July 12th, 2010. As I fumbled 
to write, I noticed that my hands were shaking very badly. And what's more: 
my hands looked dry and wrinkly. I yelled in horror and closed my eyes. I 
grabbed my head and sobbed, saying, "There's a disease. They're all sick." I 
looked again at my hands, taking a chance on them again, and I saw that they 
weren't that bad. 

I stopped shaking and walked into the hazy light outside. Were my 
hands very old? I couldn't tell. They seemed not too bad. They just seemed 
dirty. 

I went back and began writing again: 

Does this look like old man's handwriting? Test. Test. 

It wasn't as terribly shaky as I thought. It was just more slanted than I 
usually write. 

I went down to the "flute box" looking for Herbert, but he wasn't there. 
So I brought my suitcase out of the cave and went walking down the trail that 



I had come in on. About two miles along that road, I found another dead 
man, very old, who had collapsed on the side of the road. 

But then I saw that he was still breathing, so I bent down and held his 
hand. He held my hand tightly. It was like holding a socket wrench. 

"It's alright," I said. 

He whistled to me. "The ground man." 

"Just relax," I said. 

"The ground man," he whistled. "The ground man." He did this very 
faintly and then he stopped moving and I heard no further breaths from him. 

I said my dunes. 

I walked for a few hours back on the path. It was many hours of 
walking, many of hours of mundane trail. It didn't look quite as fascinating 
as before. The stream looked smaller, I tried to see it as I had seen it 
yesterday. While looking in the stream, I found a red pencil with a green 
eraser. Words were embossed on the side of it in gold: THIS IS TIME WELL 
SPENT. I put the pencil in my coat pocket. 

Eventually I arrived at the clearing where the men had all peed the day 
before. I stopped and ate some bread and hummus. Then I urinated, stocked 
up on blackberries, and got back on the path. 

Just as I was leaving, I saw that a few men were coming toward me. 
One of them was "Herbert"! On his shoulders was a young man playing the 
piccolo. I couldn't understand the tune, as I was too far away, and anyway, it 
seemed somewhat beyond my level. But it was an exceedingly jubilant group, 
because they would end each little song with shouts of dune and raised fists. 



As they came close, "Herbert" yelled through his cupped hands, "It 
returns! It returns!" The happiness upon rejoining with him almost recalls to 
mind a sunny day, but it was just another murky sky around us. I caught up 
to meet them and straight away I saw "Herbert" to be a very old man now. 
For when he took the child off his back, it turned out that he was crouched 
over and his arms wouldn't go into the praying mantis position as easily. 
They tilted to the sides, the elbow looked beyond frail. 

I put my hands on both sides of him, to steady him, "Herbert! Herbert! 
Look at you. You're so old. How did you get so old?" 

He said, "No, it's fine." He put his hands on my shoulders. "Thank you 
for holding me up. It's a heavy boy." 

"No," I said, grasping him firmly. "You're dying. You need to eat. You're 
all dying of starvation." I set my suitcase on the ground and got out the bread 
and hummus again. "Another man died about an hour or two back on the 
trail. And the man with the pith helmet died. I'm also wondering if I'm 
getting older, too." 

I handed him some bread smeared with a giant gob of hummus. 

"Is this food?" he said. "That's fine." 

"Eat it," I said. 

I took a bite off and put it on his tongue and slid it into his mouth. He 
chewed at it, mashing it against his teeth with his tongue, then he spit it on 
the ground. 



"No," I said. "Eat it or you're going to die!" 
"That's not very fine," he said. "It is food?" 
"Yes!" I cried. 



"Put it away," he said. "I am going to die." 

"Oh, you are going to die?" I said. 

"Yes," he said. "Put it away. I will return just fine." 

All this talk of returning really set me off, too. What if he didn't return? 
This was incredibly foolish. To live just to die. And to die so easily. 

Blast it. What was going on here? These men were aging before my 
eyes. These men, these Jobsian derelicts, how could I get them to come 
around? I thought to get away from this, but then I thought, "It's only been a 
day. And it does feel insanely productive, considering that I've lived through 
so much of these men's lives. I can see all of life this way, not just a few 
minutes here or there, but years passing all at once." It was terrifying, but it 
was hard to tear myself away from. 

We trekked back to the camp again and I kept a close eye on my friend, 
wondering if he would topple over. He talked much about the flutes as we 
walked together, musing over the little innovations he wanted to add. He 
talked about a hole he wanted to add. Other men had added holes, but they 
had never worked, they had always been in the wrong place. He talked about 
a method of hinging them so they could fold in half and he talked about 
making flutes out of a paste made of leaves. I asked him what would be the 
point of leaf-based flutes and he told me that flutes were scarce, so the metal 
supply was diminishing, making the flutes smaller and smaller. In fact, he 
had heard that the flutes had once been very large. We arrived at camp and, 
after all of this talking, he was very short of breath so I asked him if he was 
alright. He said, "yes," and he patted my arm and walked down to the flute 
box. 

I stowed my suitcase in the cave again and found the young boy there, 
now appearing to be in his fifties. I had expected this, and I probably would 



have questioned the boy had he not been wearing the pith helmet. He was 
playing the flute as another man listened and gave his dunes. 

I took out a sheet of paper and wrote: 

July 12th, 2010, that evening. 
Still young? Am I still young? 

I was sure that I was getting older. Sometimes I looked at my hands 
and they were okay, but the skin seemed to be sagging. I pulled up my 
pantleg. See, it all looked so much older. 

I walked down to the flute box to look for Herbert. The room was busy 
with activity, but I saw him against the side of the wall, where we had sat the 
night before. I stooped down to check him and he was dead. I stood back up 
and watched the men intently heating up their cups of hot metal. Slowly 
turning them in the flame. I sat down by Herb and took his hand very firmly 
and kissed it. Then I went to bed. 

That night, my discussion with Amanda came back to me. How 
previously I had criticized the kinds of small talk discussions, particularly 
discussions about music, because they revolved simply around "Did you like 
this? Have you heard of this?" and how they never went anywhere beyond 
that, you could never keep track of what you were recommended and there 
was never anything to talk about, maybe a scene, maybe a lyric. Those 
pointless discussions that had always left me empty, never able to talk about 
the beauty of music itself adequately, just the names and the styles. 

But now I longed to have this kind of idle discussion. To talk to Amanda 
about "The Happening". Maybe there was much more to this kind of talk than 
I had thought. Why would anyone want to have a deep, meaningful 
discussion all the time? 

The little boy died the next afternoon and I took his pith helmet. I 
couldn't get myself to wear it so I gave it to a new boy, who asked me, in 



French, "Is it yours?" He must have seen that I wasn't wearing it, perhaps 
noticed how I was holding it. 

I said, "No, it's from a man long ago. You want it?" 

He said, "That's fine." So I put it on his head and, from then on, I saw 
him walking all over camp, raising dust in his pith helmet. Whenever I saw 
him, I laughed and I could hear that my laugh was an old man's. 

I felt very feeble, and found myself unable to walk back on the path to 
my own camp, to the red door I had ripped off the shed. I thought, "I can't be 
that bad. I'm at least not aging as quickly as the others. And I'm eating fine. 
Maybe I'm letting all this death and feebleness rub off on me." 

I constructed a task for myself, in the form of running from the bottom 
of the pit to the top, as fast as I could. But I found that I couldn't run at all, 
nor could I make it to my own cave, which was only about thirty feet up the 
hill. So I changed the idea: I would try to go from the top of the hill to the 
bottom and see how that went. I whistled for someone to carry me to the top 
of the hill. As the man was carrying me up, the red pencil fell out of my coat 
and began rolling down the hill. 

"Wait!" I cried. "Stop!" 

He let me down and I spent the rest of the evening working my way 
down the pit, searching for the pencil, to no avail. 

I sat on the side of the flute box that night, again thinking of the time I 
had sat there, talking to Herb. For the next few nights I would always end my 
night there, lost in melancholic nostalgia. That particular night, though, my 
troubled reverie was interrupted by a flurry of activity among the men, along 
with lights in my peripheral vision. 

I looked up and a man in khaki shorts with dark hair was inspecting 
the flutes with a flashlights and muttering to the men, "None of these look 



quite as good..." The man was speaking English. He had glasses and a black 
moustache. "I feel like the quality on these is going down," he said in a frank 
tone. 

"Hello?" I said to him. "You speak English." 

"Sure," he said. "Who are you?" He had his hands full of flutes and he 
was turning them over, really giving them a thorough look. 

"Rex Reynolds," I said, having recently started to think of myself as an 
older man and the name seemed to be fitting more and more. "I've been stuck 
here for so long," I said. "How do I get out of here?" 

"Well," he said, still consumed with the tiny instruments. "You can go 
anywhere. Any direction leads away from here." 

"But I mean can you give me a ride?" I said. 

He gave the flutes back to the men and addressed me directly. 

"I'm Paul Allen," he said. "Of Microsoft." 

"Hello," I said, feebly. 

"I'm a wealthy, powerful man in this region and also in the world. 
Beloved by some, hated by others." He adjusted his glasses and then took out 
his wallet. "I am eccentric," he said and gave me two one-hundred dollar bills. 
"And I spend my money freely and unpredictably, but often on things that 
improve life for everyone, in ways that are not immediately obvious, but 
which will ultimately benefit us." 

"Why did you give me this?" I said, holding out the bill. "I just need a 
ride." 



"I am usually ten or twenty years ahead of the curve," he said. "Most 
people say 'about thirteen' and, I won't lie, that does ring true to me." He had 
been motioning with his wallet, but now he put it away. "You are a man who 
has learned English despite the pressures of the crowd. Consider this me 
investing in you." 

A roaring sound was heard from outside, a rushing of wind. Could have 
been a helicopter or a large tractor used to crush hay bales. "Yes, you are old. 
But maybe this is just what you need to seed your business." He walked 
toward the door. "I must go now," he yelled and ran out. 

I struggled to stand up, but was unable to, he was gone and the sounds 
outside had died away. 

Surprisingly, the men around me, these Jobsian derelicts, weren't very 
territorial or predatory, not in the least. I often dropped the bills I was 
carrying, and I would always hear a man whistle at me from behind, someone 
who was returning one of the hundred-dollar bills to me. They cautioned me 
gravely, but I didn't follow any of it. I had dropped my flute studies over a 
day ago. 

Night after night, I sat by the fire, waiting for Herbert to return, until 
the fifth night. That night, I felt a strong pain in my side, toward the back, 
maybe near my kidneys and I curled against the wall, trying to control it. 

"Oh, blast," I said. "Oh my." 

I stood up and shook it off and walked around the outside of the flute 
box. But I could feel it there. Death was in there, waiting to strike again. I 
walked around the box, holding my side, watching the men hack away at their 
flutes. 

"You idiots!" I yelled at them. "You killed me!" 



They looked up at me, but I didn't know any of them. All the men I had 
cared about were dead. I didn't know any of these, except the guy who had 
carried me, but he wasn't even here. 

"You stupid nitwits!" I yelled. "This is bollocks! I shouldn't be dying! 
You should be dying! I'm the one eating food!" 

Some men came out of their caves and came down into the pit, 
presumably to see what the fuss was. I cursed at them all, all these derelicts. 

"Stop this flute nonsense!" I cried and I collected myself, trying to 
reason with them, still keeping a lid on the pain in my side. "We could have 
found a cure. There's a disease out here, all of you. What if there's radiation 
out here? What if it's the stupid god-forsaken flutes? What if these piccolos 
speed up your brain?" A crowd had gathered around me and, again, they took 
the primate form, hanging their arms aside, scratching at their faces. "You 
aren't thinking!" I yelled. "I figure that most of you only have two days to live. 
Two days MAXIMUM! Do you realize that? You're going to be groundmen in 
two days. This is crazy, to be spending all of your time on these blasted..." 
Someone had got me by the neck and was trying to haul me off, but I clawed 
at them and shook myself away. "No! No! Listen! You need to start looking 
around, what could be causing this? Is it the leaves? Is it the trees? What is 
it?" 

The man who had grabbed me came forward again, with a humorous 
look on his face. "I am Slupchik," he said, patting his chest with one of his 
club-like hands. 

"Now, see. They don't understand you." He pointed around at the 
men's faces. "They don't understand you any more than you understand 
them." 

I said, "I am one of them. Look at me! I understand them completely." 
I cried out in pain and fell to the ground. "Gah!" I yelled, in total agony. 
"Gahhh!" I was disgraceful, writhing, unable to die. 



The man Slupchik picked me up and carried me up to a small hovel. 
"Just calm down," he said. "It's no use." 

He set me down in the cave, then walked outside. He came back a little 
while later with another of the derelicts. He had the derelict sit next to me. 

"Now," Slupchik said, very sternly. "I'm going to leave this one here 
with you, because I think you need it. But there is no use," he said, even more 
critically, "there is no use in trying to judge everything by the condition you 
are in right now. You are absolutely delusional if you think that you know 
anything right now." He said goodbye and left. 

The man sat next to me. I had him pull me up against the wall and we 
both slept against the wall. As he slept, I secretly took his hand and held it 
tight. As I did so, I felt a slender instrument in his hand, a tiny flute. I felt its 
edges, it was not a flute, it was a pencil, a light, hexagonal tube. I felt along 
the shaft for the golden words. 

"THIS IS," I cried, softly, trembling, unable to take the pencil from him, 
but unable to let it go, I cried all the tears that I had and I resolved to say it 
with conviction, "THIS IS TIME WELL SPENT," I said and, biting my lip, 
tasting my own salt, at that point, I must have died.
